This is a simple attempt to solve the race track problem in Sutton's book, using Off-policy Monte-Carlo control method.

This solution was written in C++ as main language, on Xcode 12.X platform. Visualization of race track requires instanllation of the SFML packages.
Unit testings were carried out using XCTest as well. All modules have tests except the visualization module, which cannot be supported by XCTest.
